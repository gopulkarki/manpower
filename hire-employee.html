                  <p> Project-based employment is followed when a company wants to hire people on a temporary basis to work on specific projects
                     or tasks. The employee's engagement is for a fixed time frame specified at the time they were hired, and project-based 
                     workers' pay is generally based on project completion rather than the number of hours worked. Many industries use 
                     contingent skilled manpower through project employment, and this is increasingly seen as the way forward, allowing 
                     workers and businesses to become more responsive to an increasingly dynamic marketplace.

               <p>  
                  Employees hired for a specific project quite often have skills that the company does not require all of the time. 
                  Project workers are typically paid as per the project and are paid upon completion of the project. These specifics
                   will be specified at the time of the engagement so that both parties are fully aware of their respective positions.
                    The nature of project-based hiring can make contingent skilled manpower a cost-effective option for businesses while 
                    also benefiting the employees. The project-based workforce is more adaptable, with hours determined or determinable 
                    by both parties at the outset of the engagement, and businesses know where they stand in terms of costs. Furthermore,
                     unlike company employees, contractors are responsible for their own taxes, which can result in lower company costs.</</p>
